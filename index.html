        The result of typeof alert is "function", because alert is a function.
        We\'ll study functions in the next chapters where we\'ll also see that
        there\'s no special “function” type in JavaScript. Functions belong to
        the object type. But typeof treats them differently, returning
        "function". That also comes from the early days of JavaScript.
        Technically, such behavior isn\'t correct, but can be convenient in
        practice.
